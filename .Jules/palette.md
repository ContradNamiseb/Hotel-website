## 2024-05-23 - Focus States & Interactions
**Learning:** Static sites often lack default focus indicators in CSS resets or custom designs, leaving keyboard users guessing where they are.
**Action:** Implemented a system-wide focus strategy using `:focus-visible` to ensure accessibility without cluttering the UI for mouse users.

**Learning:** Even simple static sites can be tedious to navigate with a keyboard if repeated navigation elements aren't bypassed.
**Action:** Added a standardized "Skip to main content" link pattern across all pages to satisfy WCAG 2.4.1.
